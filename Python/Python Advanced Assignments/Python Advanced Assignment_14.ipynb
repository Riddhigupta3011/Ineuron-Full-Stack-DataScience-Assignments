    "**Ans**: The assignment operator `+=` is not just for show; it's a shorthand for adding a value to a variable and then assigning the result back to the same variable. It can be more efficient than writing out the full assignment separately, especially when dealing with mutable data structures like lists. Using `+=` can lead to faster results at runtime because it avoids creating a new object.\n",
