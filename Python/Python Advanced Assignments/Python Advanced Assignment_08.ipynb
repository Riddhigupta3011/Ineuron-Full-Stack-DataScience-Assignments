    "In earlier versions of Python (pre-Python 2.5), string-based exceptions were employed, where exceptions were raised using string literals. However, this approach had several drawbacks that led to its abandonment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited Introspection:** String-based exceptions lacked the structured information that class-based exceptions provide. It was challenging to introspect and understand these exceptions programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance and Hierarchies:** String-based exceptions didn't allow for hierarchical relationships, making it harder to organize exceptions based on their types and specificities.\n",

    "- **Typos and Consistency:** Since exception names were just strings, typos and inconsistencies in naming could lead to problems in exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debugging and Handling:** Debugging issues and handling different exceptions consistently was difficult due to the lack of a unified structure.\n",

    "With the introduction of class-based exceptions in Python 2.5 and beyond, these issues were addressed. Class-based exceptions offer a clear hierarchy, inheritance, introspection, and the ability to attach custom attributes and methods to exceptions, improving the overall exception handling process."
