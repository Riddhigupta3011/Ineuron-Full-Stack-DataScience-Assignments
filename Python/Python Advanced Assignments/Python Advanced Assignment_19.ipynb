    "# 1. **Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many partnership, for example?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: The relationship between a class and its instances is a one-to-many partnership. A class defines a blueprint, and you can create multiple instances (objects) based on that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Car:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "           self.make = make\n",
    "           self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "   car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\n",
    "   car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **What kind of data is held only in an instance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: Data held only in an instance includes instance-specific attributes. In this example, `make` and `model` are instance-specific attributes that vary between `car1` and `car2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **What kind of knowledge is stored in a class?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: Knowledge stored in a class includes class-level attributes and methods. Class attributes and methods are shared among all instances. In this example, there are no class attributes or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **What exactly is a method, and how is it different from a regular function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: A method is a function defined within a class that operates on the class's data or performs class-related actions. Methods are different from regular functions in that they are associated with a specific class and can access the instance's data via `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Circle:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "           self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "       def area(self):\n",
    "           return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Is inheritance supported in Python, and if so, what is the syntax?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: Yes, Python supports inheritance. You can create a subclass that inherits attributes and methods from a superclass using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "           self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "       def bark(self):\n",
    "           return f\"{self.name} barks!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: Python supports encapsulation to some extent through naming conventions. Variables with a single underscore prefix (e.g., `_variable`) indicate that they are intended for internal use within a class or module. However, Python does not provide strict access control like some other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. **How do you distinguish between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: Class variables are shared among all instances of a class and are defined at the class level. Instance variables are unique to each instance and are defined within the constructor (`__init__`) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Student:\n",
    "       school_name = \"ABC School\"  # Class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "           self.name = name  # Instance variable\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. **When, if ever, can `self` be included in a class's method definitions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: `self` must be included as the first parameter in a class's method definitions to allow the method to access and manipulate instance-specific data. It's used to refer to the instance calling the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. **What is the difference between the `__add__` and the `__radd__` methods?**\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "   - `__add__`: This method is called when an object is on the left side of the `+` operator. It defines the behavior of addition when your object is the left operand.\n",
    "   - `__radd__`: This method is called when an object is on the right side of the `+` operator. It defines the behavior of addition when your object is the right operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. **When is it necessary to use a reflection method? When do you not need it, even though you support the operation in question?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: Reflection methods, such as `__str__` or `__repr__`, are used to provide human-readable or developer-friendly representations of objects. They are not always necessary but can be helpful for debugging and displaying information about objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. **What is the `__iadd__` method called?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: The `__iadd__` method is called for in-place addition (e.g., `+=`). It defines the behavior of the `+=` operator when applied to an object of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. **Is the `__init__` method inherited by subclasses? What do you do if you need to customize its behavior within a subclass?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**: The `__init__` method is not automatically inherited by subclasses. If you need to customize its behavior within a subclass, you can override it in the subclass by defining a new `__init__` method specific to the subclass. You can call the superclass's `__init__` method using `super()` if necessary while adding your customizations."
