    "   Imagine an abstract superclass as a master plan for building different types of objects. It's like a template that other classes can follow. This template includes the basic structure and some requirements, like \"you must have these methods.\" However, it doesn't give you everything; you need to fill in the missing parts when you create a new class. It's a way to make sure that related classes have some common features.\n",

    "   Think of a superhero academy. The \"Superhero\" class might be an abstract superclass. It says every superhero must have a name and a power, but it doesn't define a specific superhero. Subclasses like \"Spider-Man\" or \"Wonder Woman\" then fill in the details.\n"
