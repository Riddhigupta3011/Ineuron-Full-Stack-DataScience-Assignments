    "**Ans** : The change in string types from Python 2.X to Python 3.X has a significant impact on code that deals with text and character encoding. Python 3.X's native string type, `str`, is Unicode-based, which can lead to changes in how text is handled, stored, and manipulated. Code that needs to work with non-ASCII characters or international text may need adjustments, such as explicit encoding/decoding, to ensure proper handling of Unicode text. Additionally, code that interacts with binary data (e.g., reading/writing files in binary mode) needs to use the `bytes` type in Python 3.X."
