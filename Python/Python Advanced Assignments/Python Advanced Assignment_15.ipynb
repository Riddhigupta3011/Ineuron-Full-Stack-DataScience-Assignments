    "# 1. What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?\n",
    "   **Ans**: Python 3.8 introduced several new features, including:\n",
    "   - Assignment Expressions (the \"walrus operator\"): This allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression. For example, instead of writing a separate assignment statement, you can use `:=` to assign a value and check a condition in one line.\n",
    "   - Positional-Only Parameters: You can now specify function parameters as positional-only by using the `/` syntax in function definitions.\n",
    "   - f-strings improvements: Python 3.8 added the `=` specifier to f-strings, allowing you to print both the expression and its value within the f-string.\n",
    "   - The `math.prod()` function: This function computes the product of a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "   - Syntax Warning: Python 3.8 introduced a new SyntaxWarning for cases that may indicate code issues.\n",

    "# 2. What is monkey patching in Python?\n",
    "   **Ans**: Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of dynamically modifying or extending the behavior of existing classes or modules at runtime. It involves altering code without changing its original source. Typically, this is done by adding, modifying, or replacing methods or attributes of classes or modules. Monkey patching can be useful for making quick fixes or adding functionality to third-party libraries or built-in modules. Here's an example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Original class\n",
    "   class OriginalClass:\n",
    "       def say_hello(self):\n",
    "           return \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Monkey patching - adding a new method\n",
    "   def new_method(self):\n",
    "       return \"Monkey Patched Method\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   OriginalClass.new_method = new_method  # Assign the new method\n",
    "   instance = OriginalClass()\n",
    "   print(instance.say_hello())  # Outputs: \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   print(instance.new_method())  # Outputs: \"Monkey Patched Method\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "# 3. **What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?**\n",
    "   **Ans**: In Python, the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy lies in how they duplicate complex objects like lists or dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new object but inserts references to the same elements found in the original object. Changes made to nested objects are reflected in both the original and the shallow copy. You can create a shallow copy using methods like `copy.copy()` or slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "   original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "   shallow_copy = copy.copy(original_list)\n",
    "   shallow_copy[0][0] = 100  # This change affects both original and shallow_copy\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a completely independent duplicate of the original object and all its nested objects. Changes made in the deep copy do not affect the original object. You can create a deep copy using `copy.deepcopy()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "   original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "   deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original_list)\n",
    "   deep_copy[0][0] = 100  # This change only affects deep_copy, not the original_list\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?**\n",
    "   **Ans**: In Python, the maximum length of an identifier (variable name, function name, etc.) is implementation-dependent. It can vary between Python interpreters and versions. However, as a practical guideline, it's best to keep identifiers reasonably short and meaningful for code readability. There's no fixed maximum length defined in the Python language specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **What is generator comprehension?**\n",
    "   **Ans**: Generator comprehension is a concise way to create generators in Python. It has a similar syntax to list comprehensions but produces a generator object, which is memory-efficient for iterating over large datasets. Generator comprehensions use parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # List comprehension\n",
    "   list_comp = [x * 2 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Generator comprehension\n",
    "   gen_comp = (x * 2 for x in range(10))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The key difference is that the list comprehension creates a list with all values immediately, while the generator comprehension generates values on-the-fly as you iterate over it, saving memory."
