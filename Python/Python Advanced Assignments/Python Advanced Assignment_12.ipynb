    "**Ans**: Yes, assigning a value to a string's indexed character violates Python's string immutability. Strings in Python are immutable, meaning their individual characters cannot be changed after they are created. If you try to assign a value to a specific index of a string, you will get a TypeError indicating that strings are immutable objects.\n"

    "**Ans**: Indexing and slicing are related concepts in Python strings. Indexing refers to accessing individual characters of a string at a specific position using integer indices. Slicing, on the other hand, refers to extracting a substring from a string by specifying a range of indices. Slicing is done using the colon (:) operator and produces a new string containing the specified portion of the original string.\n"
