    "# 1. **Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with visual terms in as few words as possible. What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one? What characters or characters can you introduce or change?**\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "   - Greedy: Matches as much as possible.\n",
    "   - Non-greedy: Matches as little as possible.\n",
    "   - To transform greedy to non-greedy, add `?` after the quantifier, like `*?` or `+?`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   - Greedy: `pattern = r'<.*>'` matches the entire string between the first `<` and the last `>`.\n",
    "   - Non-greedy: `pattern = r'<.*?>'` matches the content between the closest `<` and `>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **When exactly does greedy versus non-greedy make a difference? What if you're looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy?**\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "   - Greedy vs. non-greedy matters when matching patterns with multiple possible matches in the input.\n",
    "   - If only a greedy match exists, you can't force a non-greedy match.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   - Input: `<tag1>content</tag1><tag2>other</tag2>`\n",
    "   - Greedy: `<.*>` matches the entire string between the first `<tag1>` and the last `</tag2>`.\n",
    "   - Non-greedy: `<.*?>` matches `<tag1>` and `</tag1>` separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **In a simple match of a string, which looks only for one match and does not do any replacement, is the use of a non-tagged group likely to make any practical difference?**\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "   - In simple matching, non-tagged groups don't usually impact results. They're more useful for capturing parts of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import re\n",
    "\n",
    "   text = \"Hello, 123 world!\"\n",
    "   match = re.search(r'(\\d+)', text)\n",
    "   print(match.group(0))  # Captures \"123\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Describe a scenario in which using a non-tagged capture group would have a significant impact on the program's outcomes.**\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "   - Non-tagged capture groups impact outcomes when you need to use the captured value within the same regex pattern, e.g., for validation or conditional matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import re\n",
    "\n",
    "   pattern = r'(\\d{3})-(\\d{2})'\n",
    "   text = \"123-45\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   match = re.match(pattern, text)\n",
    "   if match:\n",
    "       if match.group(1) == '123' and match.group(2) == '45':\n",
    "           print(\"Valid format\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Unlike a normal regex pattern, a look-ahead condition does not consume the characters it examines. Describe a situation in which this could make a difference in the results of your program.**\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "   - When looking for overlapping patterns, look-ahead conditions can avoid consuming characters, enabling the matching of overlapping patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import re\n",
    "\n",
    "   pattern = r'(?=\\d{3})\\d{2}'\n",
    "   text = \"12345\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "   print(matches)  # Matches: ['12', '23', '45']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **In standard expressions, what is the difference between positive look-ahead and negative look-ahead?**\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "   - Positive look-ahead (`(?=...)`) asserts that a pattern must exist ahead in the string.\n",
    "   - Negative look-ahead (`(?!...)`) asserts that a pattern must not exist ahead in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   - Positive look-ahead: `r'\\d(?=\\D)'` matches a digit followed by a non-digit.\n",
    "   - Negative look-ahead: `r'\\d(?!@)'` matches a digit not followed by an \"@\" symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. **What is the benefit of referring to groups by name rather than by number in a standard expression?**\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "   - Referring to groups by name improves readability and prevents issues when the pattern changes. It's especially useful for complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import re\n",
    "\n",
    "   pattern = r'(?P<year>\\d{4})-(?P<month>\\d{2})-(?P<day>\\d{2})'\n",
    "   text = \"2023-09-01\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   match = re.match(pattern, text)\n",
    "   print(match.group('year'))  # Access by name\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. **Can you identify repeated items within a target string using named groups, as in \"The cow jumped over the moon\"?**\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "   - Yes, you can use named groups to identify repeated items in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import re\n",
    "\n",
    "   pattern = r'(?P<word>\\b\\w+\\b)\\s+\\1'\n",
    "   text = \"The cow jumped over the moon moon\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "   print(matches)  # Matches: ['moon']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. **When parsing a string, what is at least one thing that the Scanner interface does for you that the re.findall feature does not?**\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "   - The Scanner interface provides more control over parsing by allowing you to define custom parsing logic for different parts of the input. `re.findall` returns all matches without such fine-grained control.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. **Does a scanner object have to be named scanner?**\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "   - No, a scanner object can be named any valid variable name according to Python naming rules. The name \"scanner\" is commonly used for clarity, but it's not a requirement."
